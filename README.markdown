## ABDelete
Demo of ABPersonViewController+Delete category (default ABPersonViewController only allows editing, not deletion).

Note that in Simulator, the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController's tableview does not appear to get refreshed after a deletion. This may be due to differences between the device framework and the Simulator framework.

## Build requirements
Xcode 4.2, iOS 5.0 SDK, LLVM Compiler 3.0, Automated Reference Counting (ARC).

## Runtime requirements
Tested on iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0
