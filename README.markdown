### ABPersonViewController+Delete
A category on `ABPersonViewController` that supports address book contact deletion (default `ABPersonViewController` only supports updating). This category does not use any private methods.

### Usage
    #import "ABPersonViewController+Delete.h"
    #import <AddressBookUI/ABPeoplePickerNavigationController.h>
    
    // Instantiate the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController and set its delegate
    self.peoplePickerNavigationController = [[ABPeoplePickerNavigationController alloc] init];
    self.peoplePickerNavigationController.peoplePickerDelegate = self;

    // Instantiate the ABPersonViewController+Delete category and set its properties
    ABPersonViewController *personViewController = [[ABPersonViewController alloc] init];
    personViewController.personViewDelegate = self;
    personViewController.allowsEditing = YES;
    personViewController.displayedPerson = person;

    // Show the ABPersonViewController instance
    [self.peoplePickerNavigationController pushViewController:personViewController animated:YES];

Note that in Simulator, `ABPeoplePickerNavigationController` does not appear to get refreshed after a deletion. This may be due to differences between the device framework and the Simulator framework.
